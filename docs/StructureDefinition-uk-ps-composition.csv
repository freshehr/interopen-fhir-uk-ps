Sections with a focus SHALL only include resources where the logical subject (patient, subject, focus, etc.) matches the section focus, or the resources have no logical subject (few resources).","Typically, sections in a doument are about the subject of the document, whether that is a  patient, or group of patients, location, or device, or whatever.
