# UK Patient Summary FHIR Implementation Guide
The goal of [UK Patient Summary]({{TBD}}) is to specify how to represent in HL7 FHIR UK Patient Summary, designed for supporting use case scenarios including planned and unplanned care, continuity of care and transition of care, and easy to implement, supporting patient summary use case specialisation for clinical workflows without requiring redevelopment.

The overarching principle adopted for the project is to be compliant with IPS and UK Core while supporting desired use cases, taking into consideration common clinical workflows in UK.
